### Broad area/overview
This paper is concerned with autonomy of quadrotor UAVs.  Specifically, the task of creating a controller which can incorporates both trajectory planning and path following.  

### Specific Problem
With the cost of lithium ion batteries being cheaper than ever before, as well as incresingly efficient, small unmanned aircraft such as quadrotor UAVs have become very popular consumer and industrial technology.  The main goal of this paper is to introduce a prototypical method of autonomous control for UAVs.

### Solution Ideas
* The property of differential flatness is used to simplify the problem of trajectory generation.
* The path following portion of the controller uses a standard linear multi-variable control technique.
